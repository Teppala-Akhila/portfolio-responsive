<h1>REAL-TIME FACE RECOGNITION FOR CCTV SURVEILLANCE </h1>
<p> 
I led the development of a Python-based web application that provides secure user authentication
 and real-time face recognition. The system includes registration and login functionality with 
 credentials stored in SQLite using password hashing for enhanced security. Tools were implemented 
 to manage user profiles and face data while enabling recognition from images, uploaded videos, 
 and live camera streams. Flask-SocketIO was integrated to support smooth real-time communication,
and Pandas was used for handling and maintaining structured user metadata. 
  This project effectively combines web development, database management, and computer vision 
  technologies to deliver a robust, secure, and efficient recognition system. 
<p>Technologies Used: Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO, SQLite, OpenCV, face_recognition, Pandas</p>

<h1>HEIGHT SAFETY SLOT BOOKING SYSTEM</h1>
<p>Designed an application for industrial safety management which comprises of creating a 
registration and login page for the users. Tools were developed to manage job codes and worker
 profiles. The project aims to streamline the process of booking safety slots for workers working
  in an industry. The workers are allotted slots at a particular date for attending the height 
  safety classes. This project enhances safety standards and improves overall safety outcomes.    Technologies Used : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python,MongoDB    </p>
